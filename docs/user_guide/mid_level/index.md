# Layer 3 – Mid-Level Features

Mid-level features capture **structural properties of movement** across units or time windows.  
They operate at a higher abstraction than low-level descriptors, often integrating multiple signals into **amodal features**.

!!! note "Key Concepts"
    - **Segmentation**: movements are divided into units (gestures, phrases) or analyzed over defined windows (e.g., 0.5s - 3s).
    - **Amodal descriptors**: features meaningful across modalities (e.g., movement and audio).
    - **Trajectories in feature space**: sequences of values describing movement dynamics in multidimensional spaces.

## Examples of Mid-Level Features

| Feature                          | Description                                                                    | Implemented      |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Contraction / Expansion** [^1] | Movement contracting or expanding over time.                                   | :material-close: |
| **Directness**                   | Straight vs. flexible trajectory toward a target (Laban’s Space).              | :material-close: |
| **Lightness**                    | Influence of gravity on movement (vertical vs. horizontal acceleration).       | :material-close: |
| **Suddenness**                   | Rapid vs. sustained velocity changes (Laban’s Time).                           | :material-close: |
| **Impulsivity**                  | Abrupt movement without preparation by antagonist muscles.                     | :material-close: |
| **Equilibrium**                  | Stability or tendency to fall.                                                 | :material-close: |
| **Fluidity**                     | Smooth, wave-like propagation of movement across joints.                       | :material-close: |
| **Repetitiveness**               | Recurrence of similar movement patterns.                                       | :material-close: |
| **Tension**                      | Multi-plane rotations and spirals, derived from postural tension.              | :material-close: |
| **Cohesion**                     | Extent to which body parts move as a single entity.                            | :material-close: |
| **Coordination**                 | Synchronization of limbs (intra-personal) or dancers (inter-personal).         | :material-close: |
| **Origin**                       | Leading joint in a movement; leadership dynamics in groups.                    | :material-close: |
| **Attraction**                   | Influence of external points in space (magnet-like).                           | :material-close: |
| **Slowness**                     | Sustained extremely slow motion.                                               | :material-close: |
| **Stillness**                    | Minimal micro-movements (respiration, attention, emotion-driven).              | :material-close: |
