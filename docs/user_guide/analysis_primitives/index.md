# Analysis Primitives

Analysis primitives are **operators applied across layers** to extract meaningful patterns from features.  
They summarize, transform, or model data at various temporal and spatial scales.

## Example of Analysis Primitives

| Primitive Type                | Description                                                                                                          | Implemented      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Statistical Moments**       | Unary operators summarizing distributions (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis).                                      | :material-close: |
| **Shape Descriptors**         | Peaks, slopes, valleys in time-series; geometric descriptors of movement curves.                                     | :material-close: |
| **Entropy & Complexity**      | Approximate/sample entropy, recurrence analysis; quantify predictability or irregularity.                            | :material-close: |
| **Time-Frequency Transforms** | Fourier or wavelet transforms to detect rhythm, periodicity, or temporal structures.                                 | :material-close: |
| **Symmetry**                  | Unary/binary operators measuring geometric or dynamic balance (e.g., left vs. right entropy or energy).              | :material-close: |
| **Synchronization**           | Binary/n-ary operators measuring alignment of signals (cross-correlation, phase-locking, group entrainment).         | :material-close: |
| **Causality**                 | Directional relationships (e.g., Granger causality, transfer entropy) to detect leader–follower dynamics.            | :material-close: |
| **Clusterability **           | Measures the tendency of data points (e.g., mid-level features) to form clusters by means of the Hopkins statistics. | :material-close: |
| **Predictive Models**         | Hidden Markov Models, classifiers, neural networks; used for gesture segmentation or quality inference.              | :material-close: |
| **Physical Models**           | Biomechanical analogies (mass–spring–damper systems) to capture dynamics such as Fluidity.                           | :material-close: |
