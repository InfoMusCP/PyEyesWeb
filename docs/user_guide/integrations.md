# Integrations

PyEyesWeb aims to provide seamless integration with popular tools in the creative and artistic ecosystem.

## TouchDesigner

We provide a [plugin](https://github.com/InfoMusCP/PyEyesWebTD) consisting of a set of TouchDesigner custom components (i.e., `.tox` files).
Each `.tox` component implements a movement feature as outlined in the [documentation](theoretical_framework/theoretical_framework.md).
