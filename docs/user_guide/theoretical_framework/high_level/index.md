# Layer 4 – Expressive Qualities

The highest layer focuses on **how an observer perceives movement**, connecting computational features with **human-centered interpretation**.  
It addresses **nonverbal communication, emotions, and social signals** conveyed through movement, supporting **cross-modal experiences** (e.g., “listening to a choreography”)
and enabling applications in **art, therapy, rehabilitation, and HCI**

!!! note "Key Concepts"
    - **Observer perspective**: perception, not physical effort, defines qualities.
    - **Memory and context**: recent history influences interpretation (e.g., expectancy, contrast, saliency).
    - **Machine learning**: used to map mid-level trajectories to expressive qualities.

## Examples of Expressive Qualities

| Quality                         | Description                                                                           | Implemented      |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Predictability / Expectancy** | Extent to which movement can be anticipated by an observer.                           | :material-close: |
| **Hesitation**                  | When intention behind movement is unclear to an observer.                             | :material-close: |
| **Attraction / Repulsion**      | Degree to which an observer feels drawn to or repelled by the movement.               | :material-close: |
| **Groove**                      | Extent to which movement elicits movement in the observer.                            | :material-close: |
| **Saliency**                    | How a movement stands out compared to others in context.                              | :material-close: |
| **Emotion**                     | Expressive emotional content conveyed via body movement (categorical or dimensional). | :material-close: |
| **Nonverbal Social Signals**    | Group-level communication: entrainment, leadership, synchrony.                        | :material-close: |
